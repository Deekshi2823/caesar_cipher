# Caesar Cipher 🔐

A simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the earliest and most well-known encryption techniques. This project demonstrates how text can be encrypted and decrypted by shifting letters in the alphabet.

## 📖 About the Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions.

**Example (shift = 3):**

* A → D
* B → E
* Z → C

## ✨ Features

* Encrypt text using a shift key
* Decrypt encrypted text
* Handles uppercase and lowercase letters
* Keeps spaces and punctuation unchanged
* Easy to understand and beginner-friendly

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt
2. Choose a shift value (usually between 1 and 25)
3. Select encryption or decryption
4. View the result

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is intended for **educational purposes** to help understand basic cryptography concepts.
⚠️ The Caesar Cipher is **not secure** and should not be used for real-world encryption.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Language: Python
## Sample Output
Plaintext:

```
HELLO
```

Encrypted:

```
KHOOR
```
